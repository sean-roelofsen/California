Monitoring conducted over the past three weeks found no detections of cyanotoxins. A visual check of the bloom area showed no signs of the bloom, indicating it has subsided. With the absence of toxins in the water, caution signs were removed.

All screen tests were negative. The San Joaquin County Environmental Health Dept visited the site on 03/16/17 and provided HOA with advisory sign for the boat launch area and factsheets to be distributed to residents. HOA manager indicated they would work with a lake water quality specialist to spot treat the lake. Water Board staff recommended the HOA work with lake water quality specialist to identify mitigation options to reduce and prevent future blooms, and provided the HOA with information on lab resources in case they want to conduct additional water sample testing.\nOn 3/13/17 Regional Water Quality Control Board staff received a report of an algal bloom in local lake. The lake is managed by Oakwood Shores HOA. The only recreational activities permitted are (non-motorized) boating and fishing (catch and release only). Local agencies have been notified including Division of Drinking Water, San Joaquin Co. Environmental Health Dept, Oakwood Lake Water District, and Oakwood Shores HOA. Water Board staff have contacted the land/water managers to discuss recommended next steps.",

No field test strips or lab analysis was conducted.\n\nUpdate: Lab results from water samples collected on 08/14/2017 were non-detect for microcystin for both the Lower Blue Lake and the Upper Blue Lake. No advisory is recommended. \n\nUPDATE 07/26/17: Sampling occurred at the Upper and Lower Blue Lakes on 07/17/17.  Upper Blue Lake sample result was non-detect for microcystin.  Lower Blue Lake sample result was 0.14 ug/L microcystin.  This value is below the quantitation limit of 0.15 ug/L and should be considered an estimate value.  This level is below the Caution advisory threshold.  Based on current lab results and visual observations at the lake, an advisory is longer required.\n\n07/11/17: July 5 samples collected at Upper and Lower Lake. Lab results did not detect toxins.  Advisory to remain in place for another two weeks to see if bloom continues to dissipate.\n\n6/23/17: Pictures taken by a resident at Blue Lakes show accumulation of whitish scum along the shoreline. This indicates an active cyanobacteria bloom at Upper Blue Lake. \n\n6/22/17:  On June 21, 2017 the  Elem Indian Colony collected samples from two locations. They observed small areas of white scum.  Potentially toxin-producing cyanobacteria where identified in all of the samples.  No toxins were detected using Abraxis test strips.  The samples have been sent to a laboratory for further analysis. \n\n06/16/17:  Dolichospermum, a potentially toxin producing cyanobacteria, has been identified in both upper and lower Blue Lakes.  Visual and microscope observations indicate low cell density and that there is not currently a bloom occurring, although further investigation is needed.  \n\nOn June 14, 2017 a citizen reported that the water in Blue Lakes is green and unusually warm.",

Park Manager reporting water quality and clarity is good, and staff are not witnessing any cyanobacteria in the lake or borrow ponds; No further advisory recommended, but lake users should practice healthy habits (e.g., follow posted signs). For more information on site conditions, contact the Black Butte Lake USACE Park Ranger Office at (530) 865-4781.\n\n06/17/19 UPDATE: Lake-wide bloom appears to be dissipating based on satellite imagery. Recreational users are urged to use caution when recreating in the lake and to practice healthy habits (follow posted signs, rinse off with freshwater after swimming in lake, keep pets out of water and do not let them drink the lake water). For more information on site conditions, contact the Black Butte Lake USACE Park Ranger Office at (530) 865-4781.\n\nUPDATE: Black Butte Lake is undergoing a lake-wide cyanobacteria bloom. On May 30, 2019 state officials sampled 4 sites in Black Butte Lake (Buckhorn Day Use Area, Orland Buttes Boat Ramp area, Eagle Pass Recreation Area, and the bowl near the dam/observation point).  All four sites had cyanobacteria present but no toxin was detected by the lab. Recreational users are urged to use caution when recreating at the lake and to practice healthy habits (follow posted signs, rinse off with freshwater after swimming in lake, keep pets out of water and do not let them drink the lake water).   Borrow ponds also have cyanobacteria present but no toxins detected.  Park management has posted USACE algae watch signs at the lake. For more information on site conditions, contact the Black Butte Lake USACE Park Ranger Office at (530) 865-4781.\n \nVisual observations confirmed cyanobacteria bloom in several areas around the lake on 5/12/19. USACE standard bloom watch signs were posted. \nStaff continued visual observations and the bloom appeared to dissapate during rain storms. Water sampling will be conducted on 5/30/19 to inform potential health risk of cyanobacteria bloom.",

The refuge also notified Ranchers to provide alternate drinking water sources for livestock in the area. Water testing detected increased levels of microcystins. People and pets should avoid water recreation. For more info: https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Stone_Lakes/visit/visitor_activities/paddle.html\n\n7/3/19: Areas of the wildlife refuge are experiencing a cyanobacteria bloom. Due to the density of the bloom, recreators are recommended to avoid direct contact with the water, boating is allowed. The land manager is collecting water samples for testing. Water testing results from 6/11/19 detected low concentration of microcystins.",

General caution is advised for water users to practice healthy water habits and follow any posted signs.\n\n08/13/2019: UPDATE lab results for three samples collected on 08/01/2019 came back negative for microcystin and anatoxin-a. Samples were collected in Stanislaus River Arm at Rose Creek, Cove south of Hwy 49 on the east side of reservoir, and Tuttletown boat launch. Low abundances of cyanobacteria were observed at Rose Creek and Hwy 49 sample, but not Tuttletown site. Caution advisory remains in place.\n07/29/2019: Lab results on the three water samples collected 07/24/2019 found the presence of the cyanobacteria Dolichospermum (dominant in the bloom). Another cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon was also noted by Water Board staff in two shoreline collection samples (subdominant in the bloom). For toxin testing, results were non-detect. A Caution advisory is still being recommended until the bloom subsides. Boaters and water users should practice healthy water habits when recreating in water bodies experiencing HABs. For more information on recreation, contact the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation New Melones Park Office at (209) 536-9094.\n\n07/26/2019: UPDATE - On July 24, 2019 Water Board staff along with U.S. Bureau of Reclamation staff visited the area between Parrotts Ferry Rd bridge and the logjam located above the new Camp Nine Rd bridge. Discolored green water was observed in these areas along with small colonies of cyanobacterai mixed in the water column. The upstream area along the Camp Nine Rd had the densest area of the bloom. Three water samples were collected (Camp Nine bridge, Rose Creek, and Parrotts Ferry bridge) and sent to the lab for cell identification and toxin testing.\n\n7/15/19: Discolored green water reported in Stanislaus River flowing along Camp 9 Road and below the PG&E Power Station (~Parrotts Ferry Rd Bridge).

He described his dog as being very healthy and fit prior to the incident. While hunting, the dog was exposed to the water between the hours of 7:00am-2:00pm. The hunter said he did not observe a bloom, but he described the water as stagnant. Late Sunday night/ early Monday morning, the hunter noticed that his dog was in distress. He said the dog appeared to have lost control of its body movements and was shaking. The dog was taken to a veterinarian, and then to an animal hospital where the vet observed convulsions, irregular heartbeat, fluid on the lungs, and both liver and brain damage. The animal was subsequently euthanized on Monday morning. Neither veterinarian could determine the cause of the dogs condition, however, the described symptoms are consistent with known cyanotoxin exposure, and cyanotoxins have been observed in Salton Sea wetlands in the past. In response to the incident, the Imperial County Health Department promptly posted caution level signage in the vicinity, and literature pertaining to HABs is being provided to CDFW staff.",

We recommend the algal mat general awareness sign be posted.\n\nSince there are algal mats are present, we recommend practicing Healthy Water Habits when visiting the lake and ensuring children and dogs do not swallow any algal material. \n\n5/7/2020: Two samples were collected on 5/1/2020, the mat sample with no visible cyanobacteria contained no toxin producing genes. The sample with visible cyanobacteria contained toxin producing genes. Cyanotoxin results are still pending. Note: during the field investigation cyanobacteria were observed at a single 30 meter stretch of shoreline. The rest of the 500 meter shoreline survey found no visible cyanobacteria.\nCaution advisory remains. Avoid ingesting or swallowing any algal mat material\n\n5/5/2020: On 5/1/2020, Water Board and Regional Board staff visited Lake Berryessa. Benthic algal mats were identified, but they were dominated by non-toxic algae. Though some cyanobacteria was observed in a 30 meter stretch of shoreline. Two samples were collected, one without visible cyanobacteria and one with cyanobacterialSamples were submitted for toxin analysis and we are awaiting results. The Caution advisory remains until toxin results are received. Avoid ingesting or swallowing any mat material.\n\n4/28/2020: The Water Boards received a bloom report of attached algal mats growing on the lake bottom of Lake Berryessa near Smittle Creek Trailhead. Samples have not yet been collected, and samling is being coordinated by Water Boards and Regional Board staff. \n\nIf visiting this location, practice healthy water habits and avoid contact and ingestion of any algal material, especially for children and dogs.",

    "IncidentInformation":"Red Lake is being monitored monthly through a collaborative effort between Lahontan Water Board and Alpine Watershed Group (AWG).\n11/3/20: Signs have been down-graded to Warning Level.\n10/30/2020: Red Lake is currently posted with Danger Level Advisories. Based on most recent lab results, CDFW plans to down-grade from Danger to Warning Level the week of 11/02/2020. \n10/29/2020: Results from samples collected by AWG at Red Lake on 10/20/2020 available: Shoreline 1 sample (16.87 ug/L) and Shoreline 2 sample (9.62 ug/L), still fall between the Warning (6 ug/L) and Danger (20 ug/L) Action Trigger Levels. Both Tributary samples are non-detect, and results for the outlet -Red Lake Creek sample(1.62 ug/L) dropped significantly from Sept, but still falls between the Caution and Warning Action Trigger Levels. \n\nWater Board staff recommend resampling in November.\n\n9/26/2020: CDFW posted Danger signs at both drive-up entrances, on the dam, and a trail leading up to the dam. \n\n9/25/2020: Alpine County Public Health Officer issued a Public Health Brief \n\n9/25/20: Microcystins (MC) levels measured at one of two shoreline sites were 2,389.5 ug/L which significantly exceeds the established Danger Level trigger for Human and Animal Health of 20 ug/L. Levels of MC were much lower for a second shoreline sample (17.54 ug/L), but were approaching the Danger Trigger Level. Levels of MC measured in a third sample collected from Red Lake Creek were 4.96 ug/L and approaching the Warning Level trigger (6 ug/L). \nAdditional samples were collected from two tributaries draining into the lake, but cyanotoxin analysis was not performed because only diatoms, no cyanobacteria cells, were observed with microscopy identification.\nDanger signs recommended and will be posted by Dept. of Fish and Wildlife on 9/26.\n\n\n8/27/20: At two of the sample locations cyanobacteria was not observed. The other three locations contained non-detectable amounts of anatoxin-a and cylindrospermopsin. These three locations detected low amounts of microcystin, but all were below the Caution Trigger Level (0.8 ug/L).\n\n8/5/2020: Results from sampling conducted by AWG  on 07/28/2020 indicate the following: Microscopy results for one shoreline sample indicated the presence of Microcystis sp. And Dolichospermum. Microscopy results for the Red Lake Creek sample showed the presence of low amount of Microcystis. Toxin analysis (ELISA method) performed on the Red Lake Creek sample indicated microcystin at 3.85 ug/L.\nSince this toxin level falls within the Caution Level Advisory Level range, Water Board staff requested CDFW post Caution Level Advisories.  An additional shoreline sample detected microcystin at 0.21 ug/L, which is I below the 0.8 ug/L Caution Action Trigger.  \n\nCDFW will be posting Caution Level Advisories signs on Friday, Aug. 7. \n\n\n6/24/2020:  Results from 06/16/2020 Sampling Event- Microscopy identification of the Red Lake samples (shoreline, tributaries, and outlet creek) indicated the presence of potentially toxigenic cyanobacteria Dolichospermum sp. In all samples but the 633RLTR01 (Red Lake Tributary 1) sample. Analysis to quantify total toxin producing cyanobacteria by toxin class using qPCR methods did not indicate the presence of any toxin producing gene copies. As such, cyanotoxin analysis was not performed on the water samples. \n\nCDFW staff were notified  of the results in the event that the information may be used to inform fish stocking or other CDFW activities at Red Lake. \n\n\n05/27/2020 - No cyanotoxins (anatoxin-a and microcystin/nodularin) were detectedby ELISA method in the two shoreline samples that were sent for analysis.\n Microscope photos and identification of potentially toxigenic (PTOX) cyanobacteria did indicate low levels of Dolichospermum in one sample and a moderate amount of diatoms in the other sample.\n\n05/19/2020 - AWG and CDFW are collecting the first set of samples associated with a monitoring plan that includes monthly sample collection. Results will be posted when received.\n\n05/16/2020-RB6 Staff visited the site; no visible signs of a HAB were evident.",
